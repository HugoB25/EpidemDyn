## Abstract
This work presents a mathematical and computational approach for modeling and parameter
calibration in compartmental epidemiological models. The SI, SIR, SEIR, and SIRD models were
explored, each describing different dynamics of infectious disease transmission. The systems of
ordinary differential equations governing the models were solved using the Runge-Kutta method
of order 5(4), specifically the Dormandâ€“Prince formulation, enabling convergence analysis and
assessment of numerical accuracy. Parameter estimation was carried out using gradient-based
optimization algorithms, where the gradient was computed via sensitivity equations. This strategy
was complemented with adaptive line search to ensure computational stability and efficiency.
